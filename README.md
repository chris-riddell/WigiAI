## üí≠ Why I Built This

I wanted an AI assistant that felt more like a companion than a tool. Existing AI apps either hide in browser tabs or lack the habit tracking features I needed. I kept forgetting to check my habit tracker, and my AI conversations felt disconnected from my actual goals.

WigiAI combines the best of both worlds:
- **Visible desktop widgets** so your AI is always present (not hidden away)
- **Conversational habit tracking** so you can just chat instead of clicking checkboxes
- **Persistent memory** so your AI remembers your context across all conversations
- **Privacy-first design** with offline voice features and local AI support (Ollama)

I built this for myself, but I'm sharing it in case it helps others too. If you have ideas to make it better, **pull requests are welcome!** üôå

## üéØ Habit Tracking System

### How It Works

**Conversational AI Integration:**
- Characters naturally ask about your habits during conversations
- AI understands responses like "Yes, I did it!" or "Not today"
- Structured markers: `[HABIT_COMPLETE: uuid]` or `[HABIT_SKIP: uuid]`
- Markers are automatically stripped from displayed messages
- Habit context injected into AI system prompt (no cache invalidation)

**Visual Tracking:**
- **7-Day Calendar:** Color-coded squares showing last week's progress
  - üü¢ Green = Completed
  - üî¥ Red = Skipped
  - ‚ö™ Gray border = Pending/Due
  - Transparent = Not due that day
- **Streak Counter:** Consecutive completions with flame emoji üî•
- **Progress Percentage:** Overall completion rate

**Quick Actions:**
- Pending habits appear above message input
- "Done ‚úì" button marks complete and triggers celebration
- "Skip ‚Üí" button marks skipped (no broken streak penalty)
- Auto-hides when no pending habits

### Habit Frequencies

- **Daily:** Every day (7 days/week)
- **Weekdays:** Monday through Friday (5 days/week)
- **Weekends:** Saturday and Sunday (2 days/week)
- **Custom:** Select any combination of specific days

### Milestone Celebrations

Confetti animation with milestone messages:
- **1 Day:** "Great start! üåü"
- **3 Days:** "Three in a row! üéØ"
- **7 Days:** "One week strong! üí™"
- **14 Days:** "Two weeks - amazing! üî•"
- **30 Days:** "One month milestone! üèÜ"
- **100 Days:** "Century club! Incredible! üåà"
- **Every 50 Days:** "{streak} days - unstoppable! üöÄ"

**Celebration Features:**
- 50 colorful confetti pieces with falling animation
- Success icon (green gradient circle with checkmark)
- Streak count display
- Sound effects (regular + milestone-specific sounds)
- Auto-dismiss after 2.5 seconds

### Example Conversation

```
Character: "Good morning! Did you get your morning exercise in?"

You: "Yes, I did 30 minutes on the treadmill!"

[AI marks habit complete]
[üéâ Confetti animation appears]
[Shows: "7 day streak! üí™ One week strong!"]

Character: "That's amazing! You've kept it up for a whole week! üî•"
```
