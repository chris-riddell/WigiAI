# WigiAI Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased] - 1.1.0

### Changed

**üóÑÔ∏è Multi-File Storage Architecture**
- **BREAKING (with automatic migration):** Refactored from single-file to multi-file storage architecture
- Each character now stored in individual JSON file: `~/Library/Application Support/WigiAI/characters/{UUID}.json`
- Main settings file (`app_settings.json`) now stores only global configuration and character UUIDs
- Automatic one-time migration from old single-file format on first launch after upgrade
- Zero data loss during migration - all chat history, habits, and settings preserved

### Improved

**‚ö° Performance Enhancements**
- Saving a character now only writes that character's file, not entire app state
- Significantly faster character updates, especially with large chat histories
- Reduced memory usage during save operations

**üõ°Ô∏è Data Safety**
- File corruption now isolated to individual characters, not entire dataset
- Each character file is independently recoverable
- Atomic writes prevent partial data corruption

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements**
- AppDelegate maintains in-memory `characters` array for fast access
- StorageService provides granular persistence methods (`saveCharacter`, `loadCharacter`, `deleteCharacter`)
- Improved error handling with Result types for storage operations
- Better logging for troubleshooting storage issues

### Technical Details

- AppSettings model changed: `characters: [Character]` ‚Üí `characterIds: [UUID]`
- All views updated to use new storage pattern via `appDelegate.characters`
- StorageService rewritten with multi-file support
- Migration logic automatically detects old format and converts to new structure
- Backward compatible decoder in AppSettings for seamless upgrades
